Final Project for CS157A

I. PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
eTRT  is a system that supports data transactions at a hypothetical small/medium clinic specializes in tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) for the management of hearing disorders. It requires an application to collect the patientâ€™s questionnaire information and a database to store the gathered data at the end of patient visits. The Application must have a GUI for adding patient visits, filling out Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) form and Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) form. The application also calculated the total scores, sub-scores and level of severity from each form. The database must be well set up and able to handle data queries and updates effectively. 
 
II. TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS:
We used Java 8 for client side and MySQL DB 5.7 for server side, Java Netbeans IDE to create the GUI design and Java Eclipse IDE to run the program. In regards to the database, we used the MySQL Workbench to create the connection and to load the sql script to create the database along with the tables. We also used Slack and Github for teamwork and files management.
