Final Project for CS157A

Problem Statement: eTRT requires a way to store the questionnaire information gathered at the end of patient visits. A menu should exist to store visit information. For the visit itself, the system needs to know the visit ID, date, and if this is the patientâ€™s first visit, or second, third, etc. For the patient, store their name and THC number. There should be buttons to fill out and store the following forms: Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). After those forms are submitted,  THI and TFI scores are calculated to determine the severity of the condition.
